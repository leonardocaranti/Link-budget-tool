# Link-budget-tool
These 8 files are our link-budget tool. In order to run it, download them all in one folder and run the file "main.py". You will be able to choose the type of mission you want. The reason why I separated the missions like this is because I thought it would have been easier and handier to change one single parameter in one mission to see the influence on the link budget, instead of having to write in all the parameters every time. The input values asked once you run the missions are either found in the table provided by the Tutorial outline or by certain graphs, available on the overleaf document. There is also an option to do a personalised mission with arbitrary parameters.
