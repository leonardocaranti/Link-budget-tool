# Link-budget-tool
These 8 files are the link-budget tool (there are nine in total, but one of them is the one you are reading right now). In order to run it, download them all in one folder and run the file "main.py". You will be able to choose the type of mission you want. The reason why the missions are separated like this is because it is easier and handier to change one single parameter in one mission to see the influence on the link budget, instead of having to write in all the parameters every time. The input values asked once you run the missions are either found in the table provided by the tutorial outline or by certain graphs, available on the spacecraft report document. There is also an option to do a personalised mission with arbitrary parameters.
